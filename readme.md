# Memory Matching Game

## Game Play

This timed game tests your memory by asking you to match symbols on a four-by-four card deck. When you click a card, the card's face and underlying symbol are revealed. Matched cards remain face up. Incorrect guesses are returned to their hidden state. The quicker the cards are matched, the higher your score in stars. Players have the ability to reset the game by clicking the recycle button. When solved, a pop-up modal reveals the time it took to solve the game and the star ranking. Users can clear the board and reset the time and rating by clicking the restart button.

## Tools

The game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. In the app.js file, a shuffle function shuffles the array of cards to create a new deck for each game. Other functions check to see if cards are matched, and assign CSS classes to reveal or hide cards based on game play.
